# Fami App

> "Children who help more at home feel a larger sense of obligation and connectedness to their parents, and that connection helps them weather life’s stressful moments — in other words, it helps them be happier. Their help, even when it’s less than gracious, helps their parents be happier, too."

* With schools moving to online learning and companies allowing employees to work from home, we often have a full house packed with family members. 
* Although most of our days are filled with happiness and laugh, there are also times when we struggle to keep our house clean and tidy.
